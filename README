NAME

WWW::Live365 - get Live365.com audio stream URLs

DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to easily obtain the direct URL of a Live365.com MP3
stream to listen to it in your MP3 player instead being forced to go through
the popup player on their site (which tries to stop you listening to it if you
close the popup window).

SYNOPSIS

    use WWW::Live365;

    # I was listening to the ambient stream from zzzone.net while I
    # wrote this module.
    my $stream_url = get_stream_url('doctorzz');

    change_stream_client_ip($stream_url, $my_ip_address);
